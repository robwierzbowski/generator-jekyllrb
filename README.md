# Generator-jekyllrb 

**Supercharge Jekyll development with Yeoman. Yo, Jekyllrb!**

Generator-jekyllrb wraps the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator in a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) development workflow. Scaffold your site with Yo, manage front end packages with [Bower](http://bower.io/), and automate development and build tasks with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). 

Generator-jekyllrb is ideal for developing performant static sites and prototyping dynamic sites and apps (especially if the final version uses Yeoman too). It's also a great introduction to Yeoman if you're not familiar with JavaScript MV* frameworks.

## Features

**During setup you can choose:**

- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), or vanilla CSS
- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) or vanilla JavaScript
- Automatic CSS vendor prefixing with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer)
- Default Jekyll or [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) templates
- Common Jekyll configuration options

**Generator-jekyllrb always includes:**

- Built in preview server with LiveReload
- Automatic Jekyll and preprocessor compiling
- Code quality checks with [Jshint](http://www.jshint.com/), [CssLint](http://csslint.net/), [CSSCSS](http://zmoazeni.github.io/csscss/), and `jekyll doctor`
- An automatic build process that includes concatenation, image optimization, CSS and HTML minification, JS uglification, and asset revving to bust those caches

## Getting Started

- generator-jekyllrb requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= 0.10`, [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) `>= 1.9`, and the [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) gem
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-jekyllrb`
- Run: `yo jekyllrb`

## Grunt Workflow

#### grunt serve

Compiles all files and opens the site in your default browser. A watch task watches for changes to files, recompiles if necessary, and injects the changes into the browser with LiveReload.

#### grunt check

Checks code quality with Jshint, CSS Lint and CSSCSS, and Jekyll health with `jekyll doctor`.

#### grunt build

Builds an optimized site to the dist directory. [Usemin blocks](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin#the-useminprepare-task) are concatenated, [CSS](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin), [images](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin), and [HTML](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-htmlmin) are minified, [JavaScript is uglified](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify), and assets are [revved](https://github.com/cbas/grunt-rev) for cache busting.

`grunt serve:dist` will run `grunt build` and open the result in your default browser

#### grunt deploy

During scaffolding the generator gives you the option to configure [grunt-build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control) to version and deploy your built code to a remote repository. If you configure build-control, `grunt deploy` will run `grunt check`, `grunt test`, `grunt build`, and then commit and deploy your built code to the specified remote repository. 

#### grunt (default)

`grunt` on its own is a special task that runs `grunt check`, any tests you've added, and `grunt build`.

#### Individual tasks and :targets

Every task and target in the Gruntfile can be run individually (e.g., `grunt jshint:all` or `grunt compass:server`). Edit the tasks and [add new ones to fit your needs](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks).

## Bower, components, and Usemin

[Bower](http://bower.io/) is a package manager for front-end components. Use it to download and manage CSS, JavaScript, and [preprocessor tools](https://github.com/Team-Sass) for your site. Everything in the _bower_components directory is available while running `grunt serve`.

To include components in the build, place them inside of a Usemin block or add them to the `copy:dist` task. This workflow will be streamlined with the release of Usemin 2.0.

## Migrating an existing site

Wrapping an existing site in Yeoman isn't hard, but it takes a little manual editing.

1. Generate a new Yeoman/Jekyll app with the same tools and directory structure as your own. Ignore the templating options.
2. Transfer any custom configuration from your _config.yml to the newly generated _config.yml.
3. If you're using Compass, transfer custom configuration from your config.rb to the `compass` task in the Gruntfile.
5. Delete everything inside the Yeoman app directory.
4. Delete your site's original _config.yml, config.rb, and any files generated by Jekyll, CSS preprocessors, or CoffeeScript. Copy the remaining site into the app directory
6. Test that everything is working correctly by running `grunt serve`, `grunt dist`, and `grunt serve:dist`. Check that the files you expect are being transferred to the dist directory.
7. If you were versioning the _site directory, move its .git folder to the dist directory.

## Contribute

Post bugs and feature requests to the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb/issues). In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).
