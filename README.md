# Generator-jekyllrb 

**Supercharge Jekyll development with Yeoman. Yo, Jekyllrb!**

Generator-jekyllrb wraps the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator in a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) development workflow. Scaffold a site with Yo, manage front end packages with [Bower](http://bower.io/), and run development and build tasks with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Generator-jekyllrb aims to provide a solid baseline for modern development with a flexible structure and toolset to accommodate a variety of developer preferences. It's also a great way to get familiar with Yeoman generators and workflow if you don't know any javascript MVx frameworks.

**Generator options:**

- Default Jekyll or [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) templates
- Fully configurable directory structure
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), or vanilla CSS
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer) CSS post-processor
- [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) or vanilla javascript
- Common Jekyll configuration options

**Workflow features:**

- Built in server with livereload
- Code linting with [Jshint](http://www.jshint.com/), [CssLint](http://csslint.net/), and [CSSCSS](http://zmoazeni.github.io/csscss/)
- Build process with asset minification, uglification, and revving

## Requirements

Just the basics: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and npm, [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) 1.9+ and [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/). The generator will install everything else.

## Quick start

- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-jekyllrb`
- Run: `yo jekyllrb`

## Workflow

Once you've scaffolded your site there are some handy Grunt tasks available to help you develop, test, and build.

#### `grunt server`

This is your development workhorse. Running `grunt server` starts a watch task for preprocessor files, starts a server, and opens the site in your default browser. The server uses livereload to inject code changes into the browser automatically — there's no need to manually refresh.

You can use the `:build` target (`grunt server:build`) to run the build process, start a server, and review your site before deployment.

#### `grunt check`

Check your code quality with [Jshint](http://www.jshint.com/), [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) and [CSSCSS](http://zmoazeni.github.io/csscss/). BAMF! You just became a better developer. 

You can configure the `check` plugin options in the Gruntfile or the '.rc' files in the project root direcory.

#### `grunt build`

When you're ready to publish your site, run `grunt build` to send it through a build process. [Usemin blocks](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin#the-useminprepare-task) are concatenated, [CSS](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin), [images](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin), and [HTML](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-htmlmin) are minified, [javascript is uglified](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify), assets are [revved](https://github.com/cbas/grunt-rev), and the final optimized site is output to the 'dist' directory. 

#### `grunt (default)` and individual tasks

`grunt` is a custom task that runs reports and then builds your site.

There are many tasks and targets in the Gruntfile, all of which are available for individual use on the command line. Read through the Gruntfile to familiarize yourself with the complete list; it can be very useful to run tasks like `jshint:all` and `compass:server` by themselves. Edit them when necessary, and [set up some of your own](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks).
 
#### Bower, components, and Usemin

[Bower](http://bower.io/) is a package manager for front-end components. Use it to download and manage CSS, javascript, and preprocessor components for your site. Everything in your bower_components directory is available while running `grunt server`.

To include components in the build place them inside of a Usemin block or add them manually to the `copy:dist`, `uglify`, and `cssmin` tasks. This workflow will be streamlined with the release of Usemin 2.0.

## Migrating an existing site

Using the generator's Yeoman workflow with an existing site is easy, but requires a little manual editing.

1. Generate a new site with the same tools and directory structure as your own. Don't worry about the templating options.
2. Transfer any custom configuration from your _config.yml to the new generated _config.yml.
3. If you're using Compass, transfer custom configuration from your config.rb to the `compass` task in the generated Gruntfile.
4. Delete your site's original _config.yml, config.rb, and any files generated by Jekyll, CSS preprocessors, or Coffeescript.
5. Delete the contents of the generated app directory. Move your remaining site source files there.
6. Test that everything is working correctly by running `grunt server`, `grunt dist`, and `grunt server:dist`. Check that all the files you expect are being transferred to the dist directory.
7. If you were versioning the _site directory separately, move its .git folder to the dist directory.
